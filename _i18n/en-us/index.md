This repository is a tutorial dedicated to teach satellite and radio communications! Welcome to the el-cheapo-station :tm: where we will always try to assemble stuff with the **least** possible cost!

This tutorial will count with some **software** (stuff that you yell at), **hardware** (stuff that you kick) and nescessary knowledge to receive signal of a satellite at your home with images like this:
